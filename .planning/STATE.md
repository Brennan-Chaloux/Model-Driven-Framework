# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-05)

**Core value:** Engineers can verify the full structural design before typing `execute-phase` — no guessing, no mid-execution surprises.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Schema Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 10 (Schema Foundation)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-03-06 — Implemented drawio_schema.py bijection table and 7 SCHEMA-03 tests

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Schema-first: YAML schema and canonical Draw.io bijection must be locked before any MCP tool is implemented
- Draw.io round-trip test must happen in Phase 1, not Phase 2 — informs canonical schema before parser is written
- pycca action language is mandatory v1 scope — behavioral verification before code is the core value
- Skills built last against stable tool API; agents built after MCP tools are stable
- Phase 7 (Core Agents) depends on Phase 2 (model_io available) not Phase 6 (tests complete) — parallel with Phases 3-6
- [Phase 01-schema-foundation]: Flat uv layout (no src/): mdf_server/ directly under mdf-server/, uv auto-discovers without explicit packages declaration
- [Phase 01-schema-foundation]: Stub pattern established: docstring-only modules with plan reference, @pytest.mark.skip(reason='Implemented in plan NN') for future tests
- [Phase 01-schema-foundation]: TypeDef uses plain Union (not discriminated) because ScalarType.base is str, not Literal — model_validator enforces primitive set constraint
- [Phase 01-schema-foundation]: SchemaVersionMixin has no default on schema_version — absence of default is the enforcement mechanism for SCHEMA-02
- [Phase 01-schema-foundation]: populate_by_name=True set on all models with aliases — allows both Python field names and YAML key names interchangeably
- [Phase 01-schema-foundation]: BIJECTION_TABLE uses plain string keys (not enums) — simpler, JSON-serializable, easy to extend
- [Phase 01-schema-foundation]: Domain is always lowercased in all ID generator functions — canonical form enforced by design, not by call sites
- [Phase 01-schema-foundation]: No STYLE_MULTIPLICITY_LABEL constant — multiplicity end labels share STYLE_ASSOC_LABEL
- [Phase 01-schema-foundation]: Templates use angle-bracket placeholder syntax matching CONTEXT.md structure; no yaml-language-server schema comments in YAML templates
- [Phase 01-schema-foundation]: Draw.io file structure mirrors YAML file structure — one .drawio file per diagram type (class-diagram.drawio, state-diagrams/Valve.drawio, etc.), not one file per domain with multiple pages
- [Phase 01-schema-foundation]: compressed=false on mxfile is mandatory — prevents base64/zlib encoding on Draw.io save, making saved files directly parseable
- [Phase 01-schema-foundation]: STYLE_SEPARATOR added to bijection — two-section UML swimlane requires distinct divider cell type; Attribute.visibility/scope default to private/instance
- [Phase 01-schema-foundation]: File-per-diagram-type: class-diagram.yaml maps to class-diagram.drawio, not one file per domain with pages
- [Phase 02-mcp-server-model-io]: fastmcp>=3.1.0,<4.0.0 pinned with mcp.tool(fn) registration; MODEL_ROOT importlib.reload pattern for CWD isolation in tests
- [Phase 02-mcp-server-model-io]: MODEL_ROOT anchored to CWD not __file__; importlib.reload forces re-evaluation per test via monkeypatch.chdir
- [Phase 02-mcp-server-model-io]: write_model validates fully (YAML parse + Pydantic) before mkdir — no partial writes on error

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- FastMCP 3.x API specifics need verification against gofastmcp.com before Phase 2 implementation (training cutoff predates 3.x stable release)
- pycca grammar scope for lark parser needs derivation from pycca compiler reference before Phase 5 — research-phase recommended at plan time
