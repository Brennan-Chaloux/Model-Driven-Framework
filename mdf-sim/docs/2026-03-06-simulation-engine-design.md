# MDF Simulation Engine Design

**Date:** 2026-03-06
**Status:** In Progress — outstanding questions noted at end of each section
**Scope:** v1 — single domain simulation

---

## Overview

`mdf-sim` is a standalone Python subpackage within the `model-based-project-framework` repo. It provides a simulation engine, a CLI test harness, and a GUI for interactive debugging of xUML domain models built with MDF. The engine is the shared core consumed by both the CLI and GUI, and also exposed as a thin wrapper via the `mdf-server` MCP tool `simulate_state_machine`.

---

## Package Structure

```
mdf-sim/
  pyproject.toml          # entry points: mdf-sim-gui, mdf-sim-test
  mdf_sim/
    engine/
      interpreter.py      # pycca AST walker, instance registry, event queues
      model.py            # MicroStep types, Event, Instance, queue definitions
      grammar.lark        # pycca lark grammar (shared with mdf-server)
    cli/
      runner.py           # run engine to completion, evaluate assertions
      script.py           # YAML test script schema (start state, events, assertions)
    gui/
      app.py              # Dear PyGui entry point
      canvas.py           # Draw.io XML parser -> positioned diagram renderer
      controls.py         # step/run/filter/inject panel
      log.py              # propagation log panel
      instances.py        # instance registry panel
      queues.py           # queue inspector panel
      breakpoints.py      # domain-level event breakpoints panel
```

`mdf-server` adds `mdf-sim` as a dependency and calls `engine.interpreter` directly for the `simulate_state_machine` MCP tool.

## Execution Domain Rules

The following rules define the execution domain semantics the engine must implement. These are derived from xUML/Shlaer-Mellor methodology, pycca/STSA specifications, and explicit design decisions made for this simulator. Any implementation must satisfy all rules.

### Queue Routing

1. If `sending_instance_id == target_instance_id` → **priority queue**
2. If `sending_instance_id != target_instance_id` → **standard queue** (even if same class)
3. Creation events → **standard queue** always (never priority, per pycca spec)
4. Delayed events → **delay queue** first; move to standard queue when expired (never priority)
5. At most one delayed signal of a given event type per sender-instance / receiver-instance pair may be pending at any time. Posting a second cancels the first.

### Scheduler

6. Always check priority queue before standard queue
7. After each event completes (including all generated events enqueued), check priority queue again before dequeuing from standard
8. Delay queue only feeds standard queue — never dispatched directly
9. Scheduler halts when all three queues are empty

### Run-to-Completion

10. One event processes fully — all micro-steps including any `generate` calls enqueued — before the scheduler selects the next event
11. A generated event during processing is enqueued but not dispatched until the current event completes

### Instance Lifecycle

12. Only concrete subtype instances exist. The supertype is a modeling construct only and is never instantiated.
13. **Synchronous creation** — instance placed directly in specified state; entry actions of that state are not executed
14. **Asynchronous creation** — creation event posted to standard queue; entry actions execute normally when the event is processed
15. Initial state entry is treated as a creation event (asynchronous)
16. **Synchronous deletion** — instance removed immediately; final state entry actions are not executed
17. **Asynchronous deletion** — deletion event posted to standard queue; final state entry actions execute before instance is removed
18. Final state completion triggers asynchronous deletion (posts deletion event to standard queue)
19. Creation and deletion events may be delayed — they enter the delay queue and move to standard when expired

### Clock

20. Real wall-clock time drives the delay queue, scaled by a speed multiplier
21. Clock pauses at any breakpoint or when in step-through mode
22. Speed multiplier only affects delay queue expiry — not action execution speed

---

## Engine

### Execution Model

Single-threaded per domain (STSA). Three queues:

- **Priority queue** — self-directed events (sender == receiver instance)
- **Standard queue** — cross-instance events
- **Delay queue** — pending delayed events with remaining-time counters; feeds standard queue on expiry

Scheduler loop:
```
while any queue non-empty:
    if priority non-empty:
        pop -> fire transition -> run entry actions -> repeat from top
    elif standard non-empty:
        pop -> fire transition -> run entry actions -> check priority
    elif clock running and delay queue non-empty:
        advance clock -> move expired events to standard -> check priority
    else:
        halt (domain idle)
```

### Instance Identity

Instances are identified by their class's identifier attribute value(s) as defined in the YAML schema — the same identifier used by pycca to select instances. Example: `Valve["inlet"]`, not `Valve#1`.

### Micro-Step Types

Every side effect the engine produces is a discrete micro-step yielded from the generator. Both the CLI and GUI consume this stream.

| Step Type | Payload |
|---|---|
| `scheduler_selected` | queue (`priority`/`standard`), event, target_class, target_instance_id |
| `event_received` | class, instance_id, event, args, queue |
| `guard_evaluated` | expression, result, variable_values |
| `transition_fired` | from_state, to_state |
| `action_executed` | pycca line, assignments_made |
| `generate_dispatched` | event, sending_class, sending_instance_id, target_class, target_instance_id, args, queue (`priority`/`standard`) |
| `event_delayed` | event, sending_class, sending_instance_id, target_class, target_instance_id, args, delay_ms |
| `event_delay_expired` | event moved from delay queue to standard queue |
| `event_cancelled` | cancelled delayed event identifier |
| `instance_created` | class, instance_id, initial_attrs, mode (`sync`/`async`) |
| `instance_deleted` | class, instance_id, mode (`sync`/`async`) |
| `bridge_called` | operation, args, mock_return |

### Bridge Mocking (v1)

Domain boundaries are mocked. Before running, the user configures a mock registry: a mapping of `{operation: return_value}`. Bridge calls hit this registry and record the mock return in the `bridge_called` micro-step. No other domain is actually executed.

## GUI

**Technology:** Dear PyGui — standalone Python process, launched via `mdf-sim-gui` entry point.

### Layout

```
+------------------------------+-------------------------------+
| [Domain] [Class] [Breakpoints|  [Log] [Instances] [Queues]  |
|                              |                               |
|      (canvas content)        |      (tab content)            |
|                              |                               |
|                              |                               |
+------------------------------+-------------------------------+
|  Controls: [Step] [Continue] [Reset]   Speed: [1x v]         |
|  Step filters: [x generate] [x transition] [ ] action ...    |
|  Inject Event: Class [__] Instance [__] Event [__]  [Send]   |
+---------------------------------------------------------------+
```

### Canvas Tabs

**Domain tab:**
- Class diagram rendered from Draw.io XML using position/size hints embedded in the XML
- Each class block shows live active state (or instance count if multiple instances exist)
- Double-click a class -> navigates to Class tab for that class

**Class tab:**
- State machine diagram rendered from Draw.io XML layout for that class
- Instance selector dropdown at top — switches which instance's active state is highlighted
- Properties panel alongside state machine:
  - Class attributes section — shared across all instances, scoped watchpoints to class
  - Instance attributes section — values for selected instance, scoped watchpoints to instance
  - Property values update live as `action_executed` micro-steps fire
- Click a state -> opens Action sub-panel below showing pycca entry actions for that state
- Click a line in the Action sub-panel -> sets instance+state+line breakpoint (red dot indicator)
- Double-click a property -> opens watchpoint dialog (break on read / write / conditional write)
  - Conditional write: user enters an inequality expression (e.g. `pressure > 100`)
  - Watchpoint on instance attribute scoped to `instance + property`
  - Watchpoint on class attribute scoped to `class + property`

**Breakpoints tab:**
- Domain-level event breakpoints, configurable by scope:

| Breakpoint Type | Scope Options |
|---|---|
| Instance created | any class, or specific class |
| Instance deleted | any class, or specific class |
| Event generated | any, specific event name, or specific sender->receiver instance pair |
| Event received | any, specific class + instance |
| Delayed event expired | any, or specific event name |
| Bridge called | any, or specific operation |

### Right Panel Tabs

**Log tab:** Scrollable list of micro-steps as they execute. Each entry shows step type, class, instance, and relevant payload. Color-coded by step type.

**Instances tab:** Live instance registry showing class/subtype, current state, and identifier attribute values for all active instances.

**Queues tab:** Current contents of priority, standard, and delay queues.

### Breakpoint Levels

Four levels, all active simultaneously. Engine pauses on whichever is hit first:

1. **Global step-type filters** — controls bar checkboxes (coarse, global)
2. **Action-line breakpoints** — set from Action sub-panel, scoped to `class + instance + state + line`
3. **Property watchpoints** — set from Properties panel, scoped to `instance + property` or `class + property`
4. **Domain event breakpoints** — set from Breakpoints canvas tab, scoped per type as above

### Controls Bar

- **Step** — advance one micro-step (respecting active breakpoint filters)
- **Continue** — run until next breakpoint hit or domain idle
- **Reset** — return to initial state, clear all queues and instance registry
- **Speed multiplier** — dropdown (0.1x, 0.5x, 1x, 5x, 10x, 100x)
- **Step-type filter checkboxes** — global coarse breakpoint toggles per micro-step type
- **Event injector** — manually post an event to any class instance mid-simulation

## CLI Test Harness

**Entry point:** `mdf-sim-test`

Runs the engine to completion against a test script. Reports pass/fail per assertion. Exits with non-zero status on any failure.

See [`2026-03-08-test-harness-design.md`](./2026-03-08-test-harness-design.md) for the full test file format, execution model, assertion syntax, and mock configuration.

## Outstanding Questions

### CLI
1. ~~**Test script format**~~ — resolved. See `2026-03-08-test-harness-design.md`.
2. ~~**Assertion granularity**~~ — resolved. Trace-based exact sequence matching with interspersed state check assertions. See `2026-03-08-test-harness-design.md`.

### GUI
3. **Launch mechanism** — does `mdf-sim-gui` take a domain name as a CLI argument, or does it have an in-app domain picker?
4. **Draw.io source** — does the GUI read the `.drawio` file directly from disk, or call `render_to_drawio` via the MCP server to generate it fresh?
5. **Initial simulation state** — when the GUI launches, does the domain start empty (no instances) and the user creates them via the event injector, or is there a scenario file that pre-populates instances and state?
6. **Instance creation in the GUI** — is there a dedicated "create instance" control (to distinguish sync vs async creation), or is async creation via the event injector sufficient for v1?

### Bridge Mocking
7. **Mock registry configuration** — is the mock registry configured in the GUI before running, loaded from a YAML file, or both?
